        Helen Flanagan stumbled into her taxi as she headed home from the Pride Of Britain Awards on Monday evening.  The actress, 34, looked slightly unsteady on her feet as she climbed into the car with the help of her boyfriend Robbie Talbot.  Appearing in a giddy mood the former Coronation Street star packed on the PDA with the footballer as she grabbed his face while they sat on the backseat. Ekin-Su Culculoglu also looked bleary-eyed as she headed home as the hood of her Kylie Minogue inspired gown dropped from her hair. Meanwhile Christine McGuinness looked in great spirits as she blew a kiss to fans from her car as the night drew to a close.
