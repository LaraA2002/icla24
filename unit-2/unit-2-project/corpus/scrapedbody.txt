Gisele Bundchen is pregnant and expecting her first child with jiu-jitsu pro partner Joaquim Valente. The supermodel, 44, has been dating Valente, 35, since June 2023 - shortly after her divorce from Tom Brady, 47, and this will be her third child and his first. She is reportedly 'five or six months' along in her pregnancy. A source close to the star confirmed to People: 'Gisele and Joaquim are happy for this new chapter in their life and they're looking forward to creating a peaceful and loving environment for the whole family.' DailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Gisele for comment. The star was pictured on October 23 covering up her stomach in a baggy sweater. She appeared to have a slight bump and kept her handbag shielding her stomach. She also notably did not walk in the revamped Victoria's Secret fashion show on October 15 - despite being one of the brand's iconic Angels.  The star is already mom to son Benjamin, 14, and daughter Vivian, 11 from her marriage to NFL GOAT Tom Brady. TMZ reports the star is five or six months along - and that the couple are waiting until the birth to find out if they have a baby girl or a baby boy. The pregnancy joy comes two years after Gisele and Tom split following a 13 year marriage.  Joaquim, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor, owns a jiu-jitsu studio with his brothers Pedro and Gui Valente in Miami.  They first met in December 2021 when she sought out jiu-jitsu training for her son and then decided to take classes too.  In early July, the lovebirds enjoyed a summer vacation to Costa Rica with her two children. She told Dust Magazine: 'Initially, I wasn't even considering it for myself. But when I brought [her son Ben] to the first class and started talking to Joaquim, I realized that it was much more than self defense.' Adding that the jiu-jitsu philosophy interested her the most: 'It felt very much in line with what I believe in and look for in my life, and how I have a path to develop and become the best version of myself.' The duo sparked romance rumors when they were seen together in November 2022 in Costa Rica, two weeks after her divorce from Tom Brady was finalized. Gisele denied they were romantically involved. Despite the questionable timeline of their relationship, Bündchen has denied cheating on her husband of 13 years. 'That is a lie,' she told the New York Times in late March, explaining that she doesn't 'want to make my life a tabloid.' 'This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful,' explained Bündchen. After months of being romantically linked, Bündchen confirmed her new relationship earlier this year, although she didn't name Valente.  'This is the first time I am seeing someone that was a friend of mine first,' Bündchen told NYT. 'It's very different. It is very honest, and it's very transparent.' The couple was first romantically linked on Valentine's Day as they were photographed sharing a kiss during a date in Miami.  Page Six reported at the time that the couple is 'deeply in love.' A source told People that Bündchen and Valente 'have been dating since June,' adding: 'They're taking it slow.' Another insider said 'they started out as friends' and had a lot in common, both moving from their native Brazil at a young age.  'He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce,' the source said. 'Their friendship turned romantic after the divorce.' In February 2024, a source for People revealed that Gisele and Joaquim have actually been dating since June 2023. Tom and Gisele confirmed they were divorcing in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage. They revealed in the announcement that they had already finalized their divorce. The stars first met in December 2006 after being set up on a blind date by a mutual friend. During their marriage, they welcomed son Benjamin Rein Brady on December 8, 2009 and daughter Vivian on December 5, 2012. Tom has son John 'Jack' Edward Thomas Moynahan with ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan, born August 22, 2007.
Peter Gallagher is 'grateful' Mischa Barton is 'still alive' after dealing with 'toxic' fame as a teen star. Mischa, now 38, was just 16 when she landed the role of Marissa Cooper in hit TV show The O.C. and went on to suffer personal problems which included a DUI arrest in 2007 and a hospitalization on mental health grounds two years later. Her former TV dad Peter admits the actress is lucky to have survived after being thrust into the spotlight at such a young age. Peter, 69, told The Independent, 'I've always felt very protective of her. First fame is toxic. First fame can kill you.  'She was 16 years old when she started working with us, so just the fact that she's still alive, I'm just so grateful.' Mischa opened up about her hospitalization in 2009 revealing she suffered a 'breakdown' and compared her experience to Angelina Jolie's 1999 movie Girl, Interrupted. 'It was a full-on breakdown. It was terrifying. Straight out of Girl, Interrupted. Story of my life... I was never suicidal. I was just overworked and depressed,' she told People. 'We thought, 'Work hard, play hard,' she said, adding, 'But one slip of the tongue in a heightened moment and you find yourself in that situation,' she explained. 'I was deeply hurt at first, and then I accepted this was time I needed to be away from my family and all the pressure. I had been through the wringer.' Mischa went on to admit living a 'jet-set lifestyle' in the public eye contributed to her problems and she needed to take time away to recover. She said: 'Nothing could prepare [my parents] to have their children jump into the overtly sexualized and crazy world of L.A. 'It was a train I could not get off of. When you're young, you can do it, but after a while, it's going to come crashing down on you. I needed to be on my own and get healthy. 'I just try to be balanced … I needed to take this time for me … I've learned a lot. I'm stronger now, and I'm excited for what's ahead.' And once she got her mental health straight, she had to deal with all the comments about her weight.  'It was always, "She's too skinny, she must be sick,"' Barton said.'Then it was, "She's too big." I was never the right weight.'  But everything she went through ended up having a good impact on her life. 'I’ve learned a lot,' she said. 'I’m stronger now.'
Malia Obama flashed her taut midriff while grocery shopping in Los Angeles ahead of her dad's campaign rally with Eminem on Tuesday. The former First Daughter, 26, showcased her natural beauty on Monday as she went makeup-free while picking up supplies at Whole Foods. Malia - who was recently spotted at Charlie XCX concert alongside her sister, Sasha - was a world away from her party-girl ensemble as she opted for a casual look while running errands.  She kept it simple as she sported an ultra-cropped white tank top, black leggings, a beige jacket and a pair of sneakers.  In new photos, the Harvard graduate filmmaker could be seen donning a pair of black shades as she headed into the grocery store.  She covered up her enviable figure by crossing her arms over her jacket.  When the 26-year-old came out of Whole Foods, she carried two brown bags filled with her groceries.  She let her black sunglasses hang off her tank top as she showcased a peek of her stomach.  Her sneakers, which were black and yellow, added a pop of color to her minimal aesthetic.  Despite having partied with her sister just a few days ago, Malia appeared to look somber as she ran errands.  The aspiring filmmaker frequently flaunts her abs while running errands or on nights out. On October 17, Malia showed off her fun side as she sported a gray corset top and a pleated denim skirt. Her outing comes just ahead of former President Barack Obama's appearance at a campaign rally.  Rapper Eminem will introduce Obama at a campaign rally in Detroit on Tuesday in support of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. The rapper will not perform, CNN reported, but will give his thoughts on the race before he welcomes the former president to the stage. Eminem isn't known for his public appearances, but he will take center stage in the political arena in a key state that could decide the election. Obama hasn't been shy about attacking former President Donald Trump, mocking him for his obsession with crowd size and accusing him of trying to profit off the election. He has been campaigning frequently for Harris as Election Day 2024 gets closer. Despite being the daughter of a former president, Malia has tried to distance herself from her family name as she pursues a career as a screenwriter. Malia dropped her famous surname for her debut short film at the Sundance Film Festival in an attempt to shake off the nepotism baby stigma. The former first daughter has written and directed 'The Heart,' a short film about the relationship between a mother and her son. But instead of using her family name in the credits, she has chosen to ditch Obama and use her middle name, Ann, instead - going by Malia Ann. The short was her first film to appear at Sundance after she interned on HBO's Girls and worked for Harvey Weinstein 's production company. She also reportedly works as a staff writer on Donald Glover's Amazon Prime series Swarm.
 A Massachusetts woman has been accused of pocketing $1 million by administering 'potentially life-threatening' phony filler injections while posing as a nurse.  The disgraced glamourous aesthetician Rebecca Fadanelli, 38, of Stoughton, who owns two spas in South Easton and Randolph, allegedly began offering illegal services in March 2021 after smuggling counterfeit drugs into the US. Since then she has 'completed approximately 1,631 Botox appointments, totaling $522,869 in client payments, and 1,085 filler appointments, totaling $410,545 in client payments,' federal prosecutors said. Fadanelli was arrested on Friday for illegally smuggling goods into the US, sale or dispensing a counterfeit drug and sale or dispensing of a counterfeit device. Fadanelli was not licensed or certified when she administered thousands of illegal counterfeit Botox, Sculptra, and Juvederm injections that she imported from China and Brazil, prosecutors revealed.  The spa owner is also accused of purchasing vials of Botox for $50 from Alibaba - a Chinese-owned online marketplace. This is far lower than the market price tag of $650.  The accusations came after one of Fadanelli's clients tipped off investigators when she suffered an adverse lip filler reaction in 2022, which included bumps in her lips and tingling. The client, who remains unidentified, alleged that she never received a copy of the prescription for the substance injected despite asking for it. Agents later discovered that Homeland Security Investigations were also actively pursuing a case against the 38-year-old. Customs and Border Control had seized international parcels shipped to the 'nurse' amid suspicion the packages contained illegal prescription drugs. Investigators also said Fadanelli was caught returning from Brazil with illegal injectables at Massachusetts-based Logan Airport. They then reportedly searched the beautician's spas where they uncovered the fake cosmetics. 'For years, Ms. Fadanelli allegedly put unsuspecting patients at risk by representing herself to be a nurse and then administering thousands of illegal, counterfeit injections,' acting United States Attorney Joshua Levy said in a press release.  'The type of deception alleged here is illegal, reckless and potentially life-threatening.' Fadanelli allegedly later admitted to the Feds that she did purchase the injectable drugs from the Chinese supplier and did not know if they were FDA-approved.  She did not enter a plea when she appeared in court on Friday. She faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for the charge of importing merchandise contrary to the law. The spa owner faces up to an additional 10 years in prison and another fine of $250,000 for charges of knowingly selling or dispensing a counterfeit drug or device.

 Instead of ordering from a TikTok Shop ad after hours of doom scrolling, I checked out the website, and I was pleasantly surprised by the different styles, inclusive sizing, and affordable prices. Honestly,  I learned so much by doing just one extra step of research and was ready to try the brand out for myself. Spoiler alert: I was pleasantly surprised, but wanted to see if other people felt the same way, so I enlisted some fellow Cosmo editors to test out some of Halara’s best-selling pieces too.     Shop Halara    So, if you want the tea on Halara, Cosmo’s shopping team has you covered. I, along with some other editors, chose some of our favorite styles from the site along with bestsellers. We wore them throughout our entire workday, during tough workout classes, and of course while bopping around with friends. The styles boast top-tier comfort and versatility, so you can truly wear the brand for any type of occasion—from pilates class to a fancy dinner. Some pieces definitely performed better than others… But we’ll get into that in a bit. Scroll for the low-down on all things Halara and our unfiltered review of the brand.  Jasmine's Take I was excited to see what all the workout dress hype was about, and it’s safe to say that the virality is definitely warranted. The fabric is super soft while still being supportive enough to workout in—it immediately became my go-to dress for pickleball. And of course, there are a bunch of different silhouettes, colors, and lengths to choose from.  Hannah Oh's Take “I wore my Halara dress two days in a row when I first opened it up because oh my gosh it is so comfortable?!” exclaims shopping editor Hannah Oh. “It’s honestly the ultimate lazy girl outfit, I throw it on when I don’t wanna think about what to wear, and so many people complimented me on it! This might be TMI but it’s so pee-friendly. The shorts are attached to the dress in the front but open in the back, so if you hate the feeling of fully undressing in a public restroom you’ll love that you can just slip down the attached shorts.” Kim's Take “The silhouette of this dress is so cute and I love how thick the material is,” says deputy shopping director Kim Duong. “The easy on-and-off built-in shorts are a genius design. I’m in between sizes and sized up with this dress, but I found that the shorts were still a bit too tight and bunched up a lot, which made doing squats an even less enjoyable experience. Overall, it’s a cute dress that I’d wear for errands or light cardio. But I’d skip it for higher-intensity workouts.” Jasmine's Take I like to classify my work attire as professional chic, and I always used to sacrifice comfort for style when dressing for the office. That is until I tried Halara’s Casual Waffle Work Pants. I am not exaggerating when I say they are as comfortable as sweatpants. They have a thick elastic band so you can sit in them all day without stiffness and discomfort, and they seriously look like classic slacks with their pleated tailoring. Hannah Chubb's Take "The waffle pants are everything,” says editor Hannah Chubb. “I immediately ordered them in other colors hours after receiving them. They're so comfy, have plenty of room in the crotch area, and aren't too long for my 5'3 frame (unlike every other pair of trousers I've ever purchased, RIP).” Kim’s Take  And because you could never have too many dresses, Kim also tried out the Backless Cut Out style. “This dress is so cute with its back cutouts, twist design, and flared silhouette. It’s an easy number to throw on when you want to be casual but still feel cute,” says Kim. “The material is slightly lighter than the OG Easy-Peezy dress, but still durable and substantial. I personally prefer the feel of this thinner fabric—it’s also cooling which makes sweaty workouts or running errands in the summer more comfortable.”  Meg’s Take “ICYMI, Taylor Swift wore this unique tennis skirt to Coachella this year, and after trying it myself, I can truthfully say it checks all the boxes,” says associate shopping editor Meg Uy. “Unlike other athleisure skirts, it has a cool, adjustable buckle strap on the thigh that gives the sporty piece an edgy touch. I love how it exposes the built-in spandex shorts on the left side for a lil skin-baring moment. Its sweat-wicking fabric is incredibly lightweight and breathable, which is perfect for those days when you're out and about for hours. The one gripe I had was that the skirt would fly up easily even with a light breeze and I was constantly having to keep it down.” Daisy's Take  “This shirt is not only an athleisure piece but it could also double as a great going-out top,” says associate shopping editor Daisy Maldonado. “I love how stretchy and breathable it is, and the material itself is super soft and has a great smoothing effect I really enjoy. I wore this to a Pilates class and felt secure in it the entire time. Honestly, thinking it might be a hit at my next happy hour too though!” I was a bit skeptical of the materials since the price was so low compared to other athleisure brands, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is everything buttery soft and super stretchy, but I also found the workout clothes to actually be pretty supportive. The Easy Peezy Dress has a built-in bra that is sturdy enough to eliminate the need for a full sports bra, plus that bathroom-friendly built-in shorts design is game-changing. The material is not only comfortable, but also smoothing on the body. Over the three months of testing (and washing) our clothes, the quality has held up well without any pilling. We appreciated that the size range starts at an XS and goes up to a 3X in every single style and that overall the pieces fit pretty true to size. We did find that one dress ran slightly smaller than another dress (despite being the same size and of a similar design) and that the built-in shorts rode up a bit too much, making them unideal for high-intensity workouts. In everyday clothes, like the trousers and dresses, we felt that there was ample comfort and elasticity for all-day wear.   We love all the different silhouette options Halara has to offer (no wardrobe fatigue here!). And that easy-on/off backless shorts design? Game-changing! We also love that Halara takes pride in incorporating community feedback when designing clothes. They use customer reviews and algorithms in order to create top-tier designs that are as fashionable as they are practical. For example, customers wanted to be able to use the bathroom while sporting the dresses, and Halara delivered—its backless shorts design was created! When customers wanted a longer dress, Halara made different length options! Despite some slight fit issues, overall, we would highly recommend Halara for any of your wardrobe needs. In search of some new office outfits? They have a plethora of business-casual designs. Looking for a workout outfit? You can find everything including sports bras, leggings, and of course the viral Easy Peezy dress. You can even shop for a special occasion with their line of comfy-yet-elegant dresses. Everything looks super chic, while providing top-tier comfort for all-day wear for just a fraction of the price.
 Now, you're probably wondering how these two met and how their romance came to be. Ahead, find everything we know about Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge's relationship timeline. Romance rumors started swirling in late October when The Sun reported that Olivia traveled to London with her bestie, Conan Gray, to visit Louis and spend some time with him. An insider revealed that Liv and Louis allegedly met through mutual friends. "They met through mutual pals earlier in the year and have been messaging quite a bit. She has spent a few days in the capital hanging out with them all but it’s been Louis who she has been inseparable from," the source dished. "They have been for dinners and nights out. They hit a club together on Friday night and were acting very coupley. It’s really sweet to see her happy." After a quiet month in November, Louis fueled the dating rumors when he showed up to support Olivia at iHeart Radio's Jingle Ball stop in New York at Madison Square Garden. He was singing along in the crowd with Olivia's best friends, Conan Gray and Madison Hu: A day after Jingle Ball, Louis was reportedly in the audience at Studio 8H to cheer Olivia on during her Saturday Night Live performance. They were also spotted at the show's after-party together and left in the same car. Whelp, looks like these two are officially an item! Per pics obtained by TMZ, Olivia and Louis spent the day ~frolicking~ around NYC and packed on some major PDA. The duo embraced each other and kissed—and in a v flirty move, Louis even placed his hands on Olivia's lower back. All of this to say... good 4 them (sorry, had to!). Louis was spotted at one of Olivia's shows on the GUTS World Tour! Sooo these two are still going strong! Louis opened up about his 'ship with the musician during an interview with British Vogue! When Olivia was initially brought up in the convo, the actor revealed that, "dating probably shouldn’t be done in the public eye. There’s enough going on between two people. You don’t need the voices of thousands of others in your head. I think she’s got it a lot worse than I have. I can be a bit of a normal person. She’s got tons and tons of eyes on her case."  Then!!!!! After being asked how he blocks out the noise of people online (namely on Instagram) who give their opinions on the 'ship, Louis replied, "If there’s a load of people nattering in a room about you, you can choose to put your ear to the door to hear what they say or not. I think you’re probably better off not letting curiosity get the better of you." Good to know!!!! It's officially Louis' 21st birthday, and the actor commemorated the occasion by posting a cute baby pic of him dressed as a French man. "One beer s’il vous plaît😎🎈," he captioned the post, while Olivia seemingly confirmed their 'ship with a sweet comment, writing, "welcome to the 21 club angel boy!!!! 💓💓💓💓." Excuse me while I 🤧🤧🤧! Louis and Olivia made their official red carpet debut at the Venice Film Festival in Italy, where the actor's upcoming film, Disclaimer, premiered. Casual!  Olivia is officially on Louis' Insta!!! The couple made the most of their time in Manila for the musician's GUTS concert stop in the city, and the Enola Holmes actor decided to share moments from the trip on social media. Enter: his *chef's kiss* carousel on Instagram, which included several ~edgy~ architectural shots; photos of a cat and dog; and (most importantly!) a snap of his girlfriend during her show at the Philippine Arena. Fans almost instantly rushed to the comments section to point out the update, saying things like, "LIV MADE THE INSTAGRAM FEEED" and, "Aww Olivia being there is js so cute."  During an interview with ELLE, Louis was asked whether Olivia's song "So American" is about him. He cheekily replied with a laugh, saying, "Not my song, not my place. So I wouldn’t know." However, he dished that Liv has influenced his music taste. "My girlfriend has been trying to get me into more pop recently—Chappell Roan has been on repeat," he said, referring to Olivia and her former tourmate.  He added that Nina Simone's music makes him sing along, too, saying, "I think the first song of hers I properly heard—I must have been drunk in an Uber on the way home from a night out, and I had my good headphones on and was listening to 'Mr. Bojangles.' There was so much life in her voice and richness and clearly some scars. And I just thought, 'Wow, so, so romantic.'" Olivia and Louis pulled up to the Premier League match between Manchester United FC and Chelsea FC in Manchester, England—and she rocked an "L" initial necklace as a sweet nod to the actor. Aaand that brings us to rn. We'll update this piece as these two share some more sweet (not sour) moments together. 
  Carrie Coon has a few hot takes on aging. 
  On Nov. 4, the His Three Daughters star responded to a commenter on X (formerly known as Twitter) who said she looks “simultaneously 35 and 55” and “old and young” (while also looking “fine as hell”). 
  "Thank you. I totally agree and I can answer this one: 43, generally healthy, two little kids and not enough rest, no Botox or filler. Have a marvelous day,” the Emmy-nominated actress replied. 
  She followed up with another post that read: “And I’m not trolling you! I really do agree! Feeling ‘fine as hell’ and loving my forties; some days I’m feeling 35 and some I lean 55, but they are all me.” 
  Others commended Coon for her mindset on getting older.
  “53, no way. You do look great. Love that you’re going the natural way of aging,” one person wrote. “As a 41-year-old mom in SoCal, I send a multitude of THANKS to you for avoiding botox and filler as a public figure. It’s so rare and so very appreciated!” added another.

  Coon has a humorous way of talking about her appearance, especially when it comes to her onscreen looks. 
  Speaking with PEOPLE about playing Bertha Russell on The Gilded Age, which she’s been on since 2020, she joked about the lengths she went to in order to become the 19th-century character. 
  "When you get to 16 hours in a corset and high heels, you just start to lose your mind," she said in an August interview. "You start to understand why women changed five or six times a day, the upper-class women, because they needed a break."
  She added that she and her co-star Amber Gray would also "make a sport out of" slipping out of their complex costumes.

  And when she was promoting her role in the 2023 movie Boston Strangler, she spoke about her experience with wearing silicone hip pads — and the sadness she felt when she had to leave them behind at the end of the day. 
  "And when I took them off it made me sad," she admitted. "I mean, you don't really notice them after a while — you just notice them when they're gone and you look like a tree!"
