- i'm not sure but i think i'll use the markovify library unless i figure out how to make the handmade code more complex than the library.

The ideas are the same as before and i'll narrow it down once i see the output i'm getting and what is mpst successful.

the ideas again-

# Unit 2 Project ideating : 
# Based on my initial ideas (copied again below), i think a question could be something like:
# Q : What kind of language do the media use to describe/narrativize male and female politicians/criminals/celebrities? (obviously will be refined based on which avenue i choose)
# 1(gathering news articles on male killers to analyze the language used to describe them and frame the narrative, bc ive seen so many headlines that undermine that violence by adding weird/irrelevant/deflecting details) 
# 2(analyzing other texts/articles where there is a difference in the narrativization between the actions of men/women, maybe in political news articles) 
# 3(similarly analyzing the way male/female children are described/encouraged to behave/complimented maybe using literature or articles) 
# 4(similarly how people intract with male/female content creators/celebrities maybe anlayzing comment sections)
